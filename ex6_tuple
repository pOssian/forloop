'''
Tuple:
1.
a. Create 3 variables var_1, var_2 and var_3 giving them
the values 1, 2 and 3 respectively using only a single
line of code in python.
'''
from itertools import count


var_1, var_2, var_3 = 1, 2, 3
print(var_1, var_2, var_3)

'''
b. Change the value of var_1 and var_2 such that
var_1= var_2 and var_2= var_1. print the values to verify that now var_1=2 and var_2=1.
(hint: you might need temporary variables)
'''
var_10 = var_2
var_2 = var_1
var_1 = var_10
print(var_1, var_2)
'''
c. In most programming languages you need temporary variables for handling variables “switches” such as in b, but python offers a way to do this without!
try changing the code in b to
var_1, var_2 = var_2, var_1
and verify that this method also work.
'''
var_1, var_2 = var_2, var_1

'''
2. Ash Ketchum has been out capturing Pokémon again. He
first got a Pikachu, then Pidgey, then Abra, then Pidgey, then Eevee then Pidgey
a. Make a tuple called “captured”, with the captured Pokémon 
(make sure to keep the order they were captured in)
'''
captured = 'Pikachu', 'Pidgey', 'Abra', 'Pidgey', 'Eevee', 'Pidgey'

'''
b. Would it have been favorable to use a list instead of tuple in this case? 
    What are the pros and cons?
    -- Svaret kan inte ändras som en Tuple. Bra för historiken behålls, 
    men kan inte ändra för att sortera listan på andra sätt
'''

'''
c. Ash’s memory is not as it used to be, he is wondering if there might be 
multiple pidgeys from the captured tuple. Use the count method and print the 
number of pidgeys in the list.
'''
captured.count('Pidgey')

'''
SET

d. Since Ash’s memory is going bad, Help him and create a program that takes a 
user input (using the python input operator), where the user can type a Pokémon name 
and then the program should print out if the Pokémon is already in the captured tuple or not.
also print the total number of Pokémon in the captured tuple, 
as well as the number of unique Pokémon.
'''


captured = 'Pikachu', 'Pidgey', 'Abra', 'Pidgey', 'Eevee', 'Pidgey'

pokemon = input('Pokemon name?: ')

if pokemon in captured:
    print(captured.count(pokemon))
    print(captured.count)
else :
    print('No such pokemon in the list.')
